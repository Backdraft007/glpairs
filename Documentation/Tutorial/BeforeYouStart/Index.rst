Before you start
----------------

At the beginning you should be aware which kind of pairs game you like to provide. Like in the
introduction explained, you have four kinds of pairs.

#. **Same picture**
   This is the standard of a pairs game. For every pair you have two cards with the same picture.
#. **Two pictures**
   In this mode you have for every pair two cards with two similar pictures. (i.e. two cats)
#. **Picture to text**
   In this mode you have for every pair one card with a picture and one card with a description of
   the picture. This is a good choice for learning foreign languages. (i.e. a card with a picture of
   a dog and the description “Hund” in German on the second card)
#. **Text only**
   In this mode you have for every pair two text cards. On one card is a description in one language
   and on the other card in a different language. This is the second mode for learning foreign
   languages. (i.e. a card with the description “Deer” and a second card with the description
   “Reh” in German)

In our case we like to maintain a pairs game with the mode two pictures. You need, before you start,
create proper images and upload them in your image folder of your homepage. For this tutorial we
provide pictures in the directory *typo3conf/ext/glpairs/doc/Images/* of this extension. You can copy
it from there to any directory you want of your homepage.
