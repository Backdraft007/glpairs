					<![CDATA[You can choose four kinds of types: 
	      									 
					 Same picture: 
					 Here we use only image1 of every single pair. This image you can find under two cards and you have to find this both.
					 
					 Two pictures: 
					 Here we use image1 and image2. You have to assign to both fields similair pictures, e.g. two cats. In the game you have to find the cards with the both similair pictures.
					 
					 Picture to text: 
					 Here we use image1 and the description. You have to find the correct description for every picture which you can see in the game. This is a good possibility exercise foreign languages.
					
					 Text only:
					 Here we can define two cards with a text. Usually it should be two texts of two different languages. The play need to find the both cards with the same meaning. This is another good posibility to learn languages.]]>
